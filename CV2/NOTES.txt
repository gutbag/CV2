Change BUFFER_LENGTH from 32 to (128 + 2) in latest version of Wire.h, e.g.:

/Users/marklamb/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino/hardware/sam/1.6.11/libraries/Wire/src/Wire.h

Need to do this when Arduino board package updated.

A compile-time check in EEPROM.cpp should enforce this

-----------------
If embedXcode updated, if the project doesn't build, create a new embedXcode project, build it and copy the following dirs to this project:

Makefiles
Configurations
Utilities

Compare main.cpp in the new project with the old one, copy if changed.
